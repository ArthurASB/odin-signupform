This is a project that was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum with the aim of practicing 
the different skills learned during the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" unit.

Displayed here are concepts of CSS positioning, form controls and styling, custom font and text styles.
This is why some elements of the website used concepts that aren't considered best practice, such as 
implementing the logo banner with CSS positioning.
